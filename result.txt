Your code didn't crash, but a test failed.

This is the Switchyard equivalent of the blue screen of death.
As far as I can tell, here's what happened:

    Expected event:
        Bonus: SGFsZndheQ==

    Failure observed:
        send_packet was called instead of Timeout after 1.2s on a
        call to recv_packet

You can rerun with the -v flag to include full dumps of packets that
may have caused errors. (By default, only relevant packet context may
be shown, not the full contents.)


I'm throwing you into the Python debugger (pdb) at the point of failure.
If you don't want pdb, use the --nopdb flag to avoid this fate.
